# prebuild

> A command line tool for easily making prebuilt binaries for multiple versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Node-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) on a specific platform.

```
$ npm install -g prebuild
```

## Features

* Builds native modules for any version of Node.js, Node-API, Electron or NW.js, without having to switch between different versions to do so. This works by only downloading the correct headers and telling `node-gyp` to use those instead of the ones installed on your system.
* Upload (`--upload`) prebuilt binaries to GitHub.
* Support for stripping (`--strip`) debug information. Strip command defaults to `strip` but can be overridden by the `STRIP` environment variable.
* Install prebuilt modules via [`prebuild-install`](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild-install).

## Building

Building is only required for targets with different [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) versions. To build for all *supported* ABI versions ([example from leveldown](https://github.com/Level/leveldown/blob/ea5999dbd5fddf8f811b6c14162a3282b24ef7a9/package.json#L55)):

```
prebuild --all
```

*Supported* ABI versions may change over time without a new prebuild release.

Alternatively, to build for some specific versions you can do:

```
prebuild -t 0.10.42 -t 0.12.10 -t 4.3.0
```

To build for Node-API, do:

```
prebuild -t 3 -r napi
```

To build against Electron headers, do:

```
prebuild -t 1.4.10 -r electron
```

To build against NW.js headers, do:

```
prebuild -t 0.26.6 -r node-webkit
```

See [`allTargets`](https://github.com/lgeiger/node-abi#usage) for all available versions.

For more options run `prebuild --help`. The prebuilds created are compatible with [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp)

If you'd like to include other files with your prebuilds like additional
`.node` files or other native libraries, you can pass a file-matching regular
expression to `--include-regex`:

```
prebuild -t 8.0.0 --include-regex "\.(node|a)$"
```

Note that if you include multiple `.node` files, you will need to use the
prebuild-install's `--binary-name` parameter to indicate which file should be
loaded:

```
prebuild-install --binary-name main-binary.node
```

The build file format is selected automatically by `node-gyp`, however it is possible to specify needed format explicitly with `--format` parameter.
This is particularly useful if unusual flavor is required, which could be specified in 'format-flavor' form
(there is no comprehensive list of formats/flavors available so one has to find possible combinations from `node-gyp` source code).
For example, in order to build using Makefiles but assume Android cross-compilation:

```
prebuild --format make-android
```

When using the [cmake-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cmake-js) backend additional parameters can be passed through.

```
prebuild --backend cmake-js -- --prefer-clang --CDUV_INCLUDE_DIR=...
```

## Scripts

A prepack script can be specified that is executed once the `.node` module has been created but before it is compressed and moved. This can be used to perform code signing.

```
prebuild --prepack 'codesign -v -s MyCompany'
```

The `--preinstall` or `--prepack` parameters can take either a shell command or JS file to be executed.

## Uploading

`prebuild` supports uploading prebuilds to GitHub releases. If the release doesn't exist, it will be created for you. To upload prebuilds simply add the `-u <github-token>` option:

```
$ prebuild --all -u <github-token>
```

If you don't want to use the token on cli you can put it in `~/.prebuildrc`:

```
upload=<github-token>
```

Note that `--upload` will only upload the targets that was built and stored in `./prebuilds`, so `prebuild -u <github-token> -t 4.3.0` will only upload the binary for the `4.3.0` target.

You can use `prebuild --upload-all` to upload all files from the `./prebuilds` folder.

You can use `prebuild --upload --tag-prefix <prefix>` for specific tag prefixes for the release. The default prefix is `v` and will result in a tag with an appended version number, for example `v1.0.0`. For [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) you can use the package name e.g. `prebuild --tag-prefix some-package@` and the binaries will be released on the appropriate package's tags, for example `some-package@1.0.0`.

## Create GitHub Token

A GitHub token is needed for two reasons:

* Create a GitHub release ([leveldown example](https://github.com/Level/leveldown/releases/tag/v1.4.4))
* Upload the prebuilt binaries to that release

To create a token:

* Go to [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Click the `Generate new token` button
* Give the token a name and click the `Generate token` button, see below

![prebuild-token](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13285808/20844584/d0b85268-b8c0-11e6-8b08-2b19522165a9.png)

The default scopes should be fine.

## Node-API Considerations

### Declaring Supported Node-API Versions

Native modules that are designed to work with [Node-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api), which was previously known as N-API, must explicitly declare the Node-API version(s) against which they can build. This is accomplished by including a `binary` property on the module's `package.json` file. For example:

```json
"binary": {
  "napi_versions": [2,3]
}
```

In the absence of a need to compile against a specific Node-API version, the value `3` is a good choice as this is the Node-API version that was supported when Node-API left experimental status.

Modules that are built against a specific Node-API version will continue to operate indefinitely, even as later versions of Node-API are introduced.

### Defining the `NAPI_VERSION` Value

The Node-API header files supplied with Node use the `NAPI_VERSION` preprocessor value supplied by the user to configure each build to the specific Node-API version for which the native addon is being built. In addition, the module's C/C++ code can use this value to conditionally compile code based on the Node-API version it is being compiled against.

`prebuild` supports two build backends: [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) and [`cmake-js`](https://github.com/cmake-js/cmake-js). The `NAPI_VERSION` value is configured differently for each backend.

#### node-gyp

The following code must be included in the `binding.gyp` file of modules targeting Node-API:

```json
"defines": [
  "NAPI_VERSION=<(napi_build_version)",
]
```

#### cmake-js

The following line must be included in the `CMakeLists.txt` file of modules targeting Node-API:

```cmake
add_compile_definitions(NAPI_VERSION=${napi_build_version})
```

### `prebuild` arguments

The `--runtime` argument must be `napi` to request Node-API builds. When requesting Node-API builds, the module's `package.json` file _must_ include a `binary` property as described above. And the `binding.gyp` file _must_ include a define for `NAPI_VERSION` as described above.

One or more `--target` arguments may be specified to request builds for specific Node-API versions. Node-API versions are positive integer values. Alternatively, `--all` may be used to request builds for all Node-API versions supported by the module.

In the absence of both `--target` and `--all` arguments, `prebuild` will build the most current version of the module supported by the Node instance performing the build.

- `.backend` Provide a custom `node-gyp` instance via string. Alternatives are `'node-gyp'`, `'node-ninja'`, `'nw-gyp'` and `'cmake-js'` (optional, defaults to `'node-gyp'`)
- `.args` Additional command line arguments to `node-gyp` (optional)
- `.debug` Pass in `--debug` on command line to gyp backend (optional)

Example:

```js
prebuild.build({}, version, function (err) {
  // ...
})
```
### Global options:

- `.debug` Download or build a debug build (default: `false`)
- `.arch` Processor architecture (default: `process.arch`)

## Develop `prebuild`

If you want to hack on `prebuild` you need an environment to play around with. We recommend a setup similar
to the following:

* A fork of `prebuild`
* A GitHub token (see above)
* A native node module

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-nick>/prebuild
$ cd prebuild && npm link && cd ..
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-nick>/some-native-module
```

Since you did `npm link` on `prebuild` it will be installed globally. Now you can go ahead and try things out.

```bash
$ cd some-native-module
$ prebuild --all --strip -u <github-token>
```

This command would:

* Build `some-native-module` for all supported targets and store them in `./prebuilds/`
* Strip binaries from debug information
* Create a release on GitHub, if needed
* Upload all binaries to that release, if not already uploaded

Before you commit your changes and send us a pull request, do run `npm test`.
